# KIWI 
- TO RUN: your terminal path should be ..../kiwi_cli/kiwi/exec/, then run command ./kiwi.exe
- If there is a "File Error" occuring at the start of the program, there is a problem with the txt file's location. (IF YOU RUN THE PATH ABOVE CORRECTLY, THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN)
- If there is an error "stoi: what()" at the beginning of running, one or more .txt files has an extra unwanted space or unneccessary new line. Delete any excess space and the program should be working fine.
- The username and password for Developer mode are both "admin". : Username: admin      Password: admin
